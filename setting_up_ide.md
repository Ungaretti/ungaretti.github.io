## Setting up an environment:
This section will explain how to make a nice standalone environment, almost an IDE, that fits on a single file or on a pendrive. After evaluating many free editors, I chose to use Notepad++. It's the best by far. However, it lacks a feature: it has no option to automatically save the file before running it. If you, like me, get annoyed by that, you can fix it installing a plugin named NppExec, but I will not cover this here. Crimson Editor can be configured to save before running and has Rebol syntax hightlighting, but lacks many other nice features that Notepad++ has.

1 - Download Notepad++ from <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.1.html"> Notepad website </a> . Make sure you download a non-installable version, I suggest the "minimalist package 32-bit x86". No real need for the extras or for a 64 bit version.

2 - Create a folder for the environment. I suggest calling it "RedIDE", inside the "Documents" folder.

3 - Unpack Notepad++ in this folder.

4 - Download RED and unpack it in this same folder.

5 - Donload RED syntax highlight file from <a href="https://github.com/Ungaretti/Notepad-config-file-for-Red-Language"> HERE </a> . Use the download zip button. Unpack it in the RedIDE folder too.

6 - I suggest you also create a "Programs" folder inside RedIDE. You will end up with something like this:

7 - Open Notepad++ and goto "Language/Define your language..." . Click on "Import..." and choose the downloaded "Red-lang.xml". A popup will tell you that the import was sucessfull.

8 - Check the box "Ignore case" and add "red" to the "Ext." box. Click in "Save As..." and save as "Red".

9 - Open the "Settings/Preferences/Auto Completion" window. Check the boxes for "()", "" "{}" and "[]". If you can't find those in the options, create a "matched pair".

9 - Open the "Run/Run.." window and write down the name of the RED executable file you donwloaded folowed by a space and "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)", with the quotes. Click on save, give it your favorite shortcut keys and a name like "Red_Run" (remember that  later you may want to add a "Red_Compile" etc.), and clik "OK"
