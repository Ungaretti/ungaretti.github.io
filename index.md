# RED Language

A guide for those who want to get things done.
Windows only! 
Sorry, but that is the vast majority. If you use Linux you probably don't need this guide anyway, and my wife won't let me use her mac.

## Setting up an environment:
This section will explain how to make a nice standalone environment, almost an IDE, that fits on a single file or on a pendrive. After evaluating many free editors, I chose to use Notepad++. It is by far the best. However, it lacks a feature that annoys me a lot: it has no option to automatically save the file before running it. If you, like me, think that's a major flaw, you can fix it installing a plugin named NppExec, but I will not cover this here.

1 - Download Notepad++ - make sure you download a non installable version, I suggest the "minimalist package 32-bit x86". No real need for the extras or for a 64 bit version.

2 - Create a folder for the environment. I suggest calling it "RedIDE" and making inside the "Documents" folder.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Ungaretti/ungaretti.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
