# Things I've been working at:


## use24h:
An authorization system for the Internet of Things (IoT). Please, check <a href="http://www.use24h.com/"> use24h's website </a>.
## Red programming language:
<a href="https://www.red-lang.org/"> The Red programming language </a> is a direct descendent of Rebol. I keep the <a href="http://helpin.red/"> helpin.red website </a> to help people learn it.
## ESP8266:
Since <a href="http://www.use24h.com/"> use24h </a> is based on these cheap but powerful devices, I have been involved in firmware development for those. First in Lua, and now in C++ (Arduino IDE)
